## üîñ Background   
Learned societies lead and support researchers from around the world. They also recognize and reward their efforts and achievements via awards and prizes. Awards and prizes are likely to proliferate with growing size of the research community and increasing competition for limited resources. At the same time, there is a movement towards recognizing contributions other than pure research (e.g. for teaching, mentoring, outreach) likely resulting in increasing diversity of the award types in recent years. However, currently there only exists anecdotal evidence on the historical trends in award numbers and types. As such, establishing timelines of changes in awards numbers and their composition can shed light on the cultural shifts, and current state, of academic recognition. In this project, we will focus on a pre-determined broad sample of international learned societies in the fields of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.  

## üèπ Aims and approach  
This project aims to collate information on awards given by international learned societies in the fields of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. We will conduct a survey of a broad sample of such societies with publicly available information. Our findings will be openly available and disseminated in the research community.      

## ü™ì Impact  
We expect that our findings will contribute to culture change fostering more equitable and open science.    

## üíé Team  
We have an diverse and open team of early- and mid-career researchers who are contributing to this project. We warmly encourage contributors from traditionally underrepresented and marginalised groups in research.    

Currently, the team is finalised and we no longer accept new contributors. Please get in touch if you are interested in contributing to our future projects.   

## üíõ Contributing  
Overall, when you work with us:   
- We welcome researchers with all backgrounds and walks of life o contribute to this project.   
- You do not need any special research skills - just attention to detail, Internet access and some time available.   
- You will need to fill in the Expression Of Interest (EOI) form to provide us with your details. If you would like to join us and are from traditionally underrepresented and marginalized groups in research, please let get in touch with the project leads for the link to the EOI form.   
- We already had an initial virtual hackathon (an initial information and feedback meeting) in October 2024, but we can schedule additional virtual meetings if you feel like you would like to chat with the leaders or other project participants. Send your suggestions!  
- We will do all the work asynchronously online until we complete all tasks of the project.    
- For more details on how to contribute and how we deal with recognizing everybody's contributions see our full [CONTRIBUTION GUIDE](/CONTRIBUTING.md).  
- We expect all project contributors to familiarize themselves and follow our [CODE OF CONDUCT](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).   
- If you would like to comment on this project or provide suggestions to improve it, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or reach directly to us via email or a dedicated SORTEE (the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, www.sortee.org) Slack channel (join SORTEE and get invited to their Slack workspace, then join channel #conf2024-h05-diversity-of-dei-committees-across-international-learned-societies.
- We will periodically send you updates on the project progress. Our main way of communicating is via emails and comments on shared Google Docs (used for data collection). We will email specific contributing instructions to the project participants, for the project tasks they are assigned to.
- We will provide clarifications and answer questions via email and dedicated Slack channel, as needed (please get in touch when you need help or explanations). Importantly, please let us know when you are stuck or you do not have time to finish a given task, so we can find replacement and keep moving forward. 
- All contributions to this project are voluntary. We will not provide financial remuneration for any contributions (we have no dedicated funding for this project).
- You can withdraw from the project at any time.
